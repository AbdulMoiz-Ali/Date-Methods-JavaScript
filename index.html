      <h1>-: Getting the current date and time :-</h1>
      <p class="ali">
        Your webpage includes a notice telling the user the current local date
        and time in his <br />
        particular time zone. But what is the current date and time? Here's how
        JavaScript finds out. <br />
        var rightNow = new Date(); <br />
        The statement above creates something called a Date object. This is what
        it looks like <br />
        Note that JavaScript gets this information from the user's computer. It
        is only as accurate <br />
        as the computer's date and time settings. For example, if the user just
        moved from the U.S. <br />
        West Coast to the U.S. East Coast and hasn't reset the time zone on his
        computer, the computer <br />
        will still be on Pacific Time. The Date object, too, will be on Pacific
        Time. <br />
        The Date object may resemble a string, but it isn't one. For example,
        you can't use <br />
        methods on it like charAt, indexOf, or slice. <br />
        If you need the Date object to be a string, you can convert it to one
        the same way you <br />
        convert a number to a string. <br />
        var dateString = rightNow.toString(); <br />
        The code above converts the Date object represented by the variable
        rightNow to a <br />
        string and assigns the string to the variable dateString. <br />
        Most of the time, you'll just want to extract some of the information
        from the Date object <br />
        without converting it to a string. <br />
        I'm going to show you how to extract the individual pieces of the Date
        object. In this <br />
        chapter I'll get you started with the first piece. In the next chapter
        I'll cover the rest. <br />
        The following code creates a new Date object, assigns it to the variable
        rightNow, <br />
        extracts the day of the week, and assigns the day of the week to the
        variable theDay. <br />
        1 var rightNow = new Date(); <br />
        2 var theDay = rightNow.getDay(); <br />
        In the diagram of the Date object that I showed you above, the day of
        the week was <br />
        represented as "Mon." But when you extract the day of the week from the
        object, it's <br />
        represented as a number. Days are designated by a number from 0 for
        Sunday through 6 for <br />
        Saturday. This means that you'll need a bit of code to convert it back
        into a day name like <br />
        "Mon." <br />
        1 var dayNames = ["Sun", "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat"];
        <br />
        2 var now = new Date(); <br />
        3 var theDay = now.getDay(); <br />
        4 var nameOfToday = dayNames[theDay]; <br />
        Here's what's going on: <br />
        1. Creates an array of days starting with "Sun" and assigns it to
        dayNames. <br />
        2. Creates a new Date object and assigns it to now. <br />
        3. Extracts the day of the week as a number and assigns it to theDay.
        <br />
        4. Uses the day number as an index to specify the correct array element,
        i.e. the day name. <br />

      <h1>-: Extracting parts of the date and time :-</h1>
      <p class="ali">
        Here's a summary of important methods for extracting pieces of the Date
        object. <br />
        I covered getDay in the last chapter. Let's look at the rest of the
        extraction methods. Like <br />
        getDay, getMonth gives you not the spelled-out name of the month shown
        in the Date object, <br />
        but a number. The following code produces a month number ranging from 0
        for January through <br />
        11 for December. <br />
        1 var d = new Date(); <br />
        2 var currentMonth = d.getMonth(); <br />
        getDate gives you a number for the day of the month. <br />
        var dayOfMonth = d.getDate(); <br />
        getFullYear gives you a 4-digit number for the year. <br />
        var currYr = d.getFullYear(); <br />
        getHours gives you a number from 0 through 23 corresponding to midnight
        through 11 <br />
        p.m. <br />
        var currentHrs = d.getHours(); <br />
        getMinutes gives you a number from 0 through 59. <br />
        var currMins = d.getMinutes(); <br />
        getSeconds gives you a number from 0 through 59. <br />
        var currSecs = d.getSeconds() <br />
        getMilliseconds gives you a number from 0 through 999. <br />
        var currMills = d.getMilliseconds(); <br />
        getTime gives you the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since
        midnight, Jan. 1, <br />
        1970. <br />
        var millsSince = d.getTime(); <br />

      <h1>-: Specifying a date and time :-</h1>
      <p class="ali">
        How many days before the U.S. Social Security program goes broke? <br />
        Let's start with the estimated date. According to the system's trustees,
        the money will run <br />
        out in 2035. They didn't pin down an exact date. Let's pick the middle
        of the year—June 30. <br />
        Okay, that's the hard part—pinpointing doomsday. Once we have that,
        constructing a dayby-day countdown is a JavaScript romp. <br />
        You already know how to do the first step, creating a Date object for
        the current date and <br />
        time: <br />
        1 var today = new Date(); <br />
        Next, you create a second Date object. But this time you specify the
        future date, June 30, <br />
        2035. <br />
        2 var doomsday = new Date("June 30, 2035"); <br />
        Notice how the date is specified. It's in quotes. The month is spelled
        out. There's a <br />
        comma after the day of the month. The year is expressed in four digits.
        <br />
        Next, you extract from both dates the milliseconds that have elapsed
        since the reference <br />
        date of January 1, 1970. <br />
        3 var msToday = today.getTime(); <br />
        4 var msDoomsday = doomsday.getTime(); <br />
        You calculate the difference. <br />
        5 var msDiff = msDoomsday - msToday; <br />
        Some simple math converts the milliseconds to days. <br />
        6 var dDiff = msDiff / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24); <br />
        The huge number created by the math inside the parentheses converts the
        milliseconds <br />
        into seconds (1000), minutes (60), hours (60), and days (24). <br />
        You want a number that represents whole days, so you round down. The
        following <br />
        statement rounds the number of days, which is probably a floating-point
        number, down to an <br />
        integer. <br />
        7 dDiff = Math.floor(dDiff); <br />
        Here's the whole thing, condensed into something that looks more like
        production code <br />
        1 var msDiff = new Date("June 30, 2035").getTime() - new
        Date().getTime(); <br />
        2 var daysTillDoom = Mathfloor(msDiff / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)); <br />
        Line 1 subtracts the milliseconds since the reference date of the
        current moment from the <br />
        milliseconds since the reference date of June 30, 2035. Line 2 converts
        the milliseconds to <br />
        days and rounds down. <br />
        If the time is important, you can specify that as well. <br />
        var d = new Date("July 21, 1983 13:25:00"); <br />
        Note the form used to specify the time: No comma after the date. 24-hour
        time. Colons <br />
        separating hours, minutes, and seconds <br />
